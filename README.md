# Spy-Bronzebeard
## Spy Addon fixed to work in bronzebeard server.

- Since bronzebeard haven't launched yet i haven't been able to test if the player detection works correctly, but every other addon functionality works.
- If you detect any error or malfunction of the addon let me know with as much detail as you can and i will try to fix it.
